## About Me
Hello! I am Simbyote, also known as Mike Orduna. I am a university student aspiring to become an embedded systems engineer. 
My journey in computer engineering has equipped me with foundational knowledge in calculus, circuits, and digital logics. 
I am proficient in C++ and am currently expanding my skills in C and Python. With over 8 years of experience in the customer 
service industry, I have developed strong soft skills such as communication, teamwork, organization, time management, and 
slight experience in management roles.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: C++, C, Python
- Technical Skills: Circuit analysis, Digital Logic Design, Operating Systems
- Soft Skills: Communication, Teamwork, Organization, Time Management

## Projects

### Circuit Analyzer
I am currently developing a circuit analyzerâ€”a simulation program aimed at boosting my coding organization skills, exploring 
various data structures and algorithms, and deepening my understanding of circuits and their components. This project emphasizes 
my knowledge in calculus and algebra.

### Custom Operating System Development
My ambition lies in developing a custom operating system. While I've only scratched the surface by implementing a basic bootloader 
following the guide from wiki.osdev.org, I plan to return to this project after strengthening my skills through other endeavors. 
I aim to resume development within the next year, once my Circuit Analyzer project reaches a stable state.
