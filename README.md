# Simbyote

## About Me
Hello! I am Simbyote, also known as Mike Orduna. I am a senior in Texas State University and am aspiring embedded engineer. I have been
During my time at Texas State, I have been working and studying which has allowed me to develop both the technical and
soft skills that I have been using while developing my projects

## Skills
- Programming Languages: C/C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, Rust, Verilog
- Technical Skills: Circuit Design, Breadboarding, Emedded Systems Development
- Soft Skills: Communication, Teamwork, Organization, Time Management

## Projects
I have been working on a few projects that showcase my interests and skills in embedded systems and circuit design. Some highlights include:

### Designing a CPU
I recently began exploring Verilog to develop circuit logic at the micron level. Using GTKWave, I can simulate bit-level operations and analyze their behavior. This project has been both fun and rewarding, and I plan to expand it into a fully functional CPU. My long-term goals include adding more features, optimizing the design, and maintaining an organized development process.

### Circuit Game -- Circuit Analyzer
This project started as a personal challenge to deepen my understanding of circuit fundamentals while exploring advanced features of C/C++. The circuit emulator analyzes relationships between components in various diagrams. Over time, it has gone through several iterations, each becoming more organized and flexible. Itâ€™s been an excellent learning experience and a showcase of my growth as a developer.

### App Design/ Interface for Circuit Game
To make the circuit game more user-friendly, I began creating a graphical interface. This led me to learn Kotlin and Android app development. While this project is currently in its early stages, it represents my interest in creating intuitive and accessible tools for others to use. I plan to revisit this once the underlying circuit game functionality is fully fleshed out.
